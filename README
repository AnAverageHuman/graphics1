Abusing Makefiles Edition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requires GNU Make, which is the default make for most systems that have it.
Requires bash for a few constructs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:
$ make
Running the default target destroys old images with the same target name.
A PPM is generated with rectangular dimensions between $LB and $HB.

If you need to debug the Makefile itself, declare the variable $V:
$ V=[...] make
or
$ make V=[...]
It does not matter what $V is set to, just that it exists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

This is (mostly) a proof of concept and is not meant to run fast. It took about
6m23.998s to generate a 849*732 image.

The algorithm should allow parallel processing, but currently does not build in
parallel for reasons unknown.
It might be possible to further optimize this by creating a matrix of targets,
so that creation of individual pixels can itself be parallelized.
Alternatively, since we currently aren't doing anything special with the rows
and columns, we can really just have one generator for pixels to generate W*H
pixels.
